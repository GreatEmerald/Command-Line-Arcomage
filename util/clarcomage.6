.SH NAME
CLArcomage \- Command-line tower-building card game
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B clarcomage
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B CLArcomage
is a card game in which two players race to build their tower to the top, demolish the opponent's tower, or accumulate a lot of resources. That is done by playing cards that have different effects.

You can play either against an AI opponent or in a hotseat game. You play the card by entering its ID when prompted, then either entering "1", "Yes", "yes", "y", "True" or "true" to discard it, or anything else to not discard it and play it.

.B CLArcomage
is the command-line frontend to
.BR libarcomage ,
written in the D programming language. See the
.B FILES
section for how paths are arranged.

Usually it is preferable to use a graphical client, such as
.BR darcomage (6),
but when OpenGL or a graphical server is not available,
.B CLArcomage
is a good choice.
.SH OPTIONS
No options. The program is interactive.
